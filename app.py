# --- OCR Engine Path (Crucial for pytesseract) ---
# For local development:
# You might need to set the path to your Tesseract executable.
# Example for Windows: pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
# Example for Linux/macOS: pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = '/usr/local/bin/tesseract' (or similar)

# For Streamlit Cloud:
# Tesseract needs to be installed via apt-get in a packages.txt file.
# Streamlit Cloud's environment usually has Tesseract installed in a default path,
# so explicitly setting pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd might not be necessary.
# However, if it fails, you might need to find the correct path on Streamlit Cloud's system.
# We'll assume the default path works after installing via packages.txt.
